Hi 

I probably should have joined this community years ago. Oh well... time to get back on the horse ond get some chops back.
I've been a software engineer and automation, test, QA engineer for several big companies over the last 30yrs. I've been healing an arm injury for the last six months, so it's time to try to build myse3lf back up to some useful status on my personal projects and any kind contributions I can make to the communiity.

Cheers!
