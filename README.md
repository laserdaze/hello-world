GitHub Beginnings

Hi 

I probably should have joined this community years ago. Oh well... time to get back on the horse ond get some chops back.
I've been a software engineer and automation, test, QA engineer for several big companies over the last 30yrs. I've been healing an arm injury for the last six months, so it's time to try to build myself back up to some useful status on my personal projects and any kind of contributions I can make in the communiity.

Cheers!

Well... long time no edit... After getting my arm healed, I find out I have cancer... so, that is the biggest reason for the long hiatus. Oh well, I now have a good reason to start using GetHub pretty much daily now with a new project. Stay tuned...
